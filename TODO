VMBot TODO list

* Add exception handling throughout the code
* promote/fire commands to act accordingly on the director ACL
* Send replies with many lines via pm instead of channel
* Improve route command (Jump Bridges) - hold for now, route pending removal
* Split vmbot.py into logical modules in separate files (fun, admin, api lookups, other, ...). It's getting big.
* Add font formatting (colors, emphasis) to make output easier to read. Bad luck for those using cli clients/disabled user formatting
